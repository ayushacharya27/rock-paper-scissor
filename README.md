# Rock Paper Scissors Game with MediaPipe and Arduino

This project implements an unbeatable Rock Paper Scissors game where a computer, powered by Google's MediaPipe for hand tracking, always wins. The computer "reads" your hand gestures via a camera and communicates with an Arduino to move servos that control a physical hand, replicating the moves.

## Project Overview

The program uses MediaPipe's hand-tracking feature to identify hand gestures for Rock, Paper, and Scissors. Once a gesture is detected, the program communicates with an Arduino via serial communication to move servo motors that control a cardboard hand, defying the user's hand gestures.

### Key Features
- **Unbeatable Computer**: The computer is programmed to always win by showing a counter gesture to the one recognized.
- **MediaPipe for Gesture Recognition**: Hand gestures are tracked using MediaPipe's predefined coordinates without requiring custom training.
- **Arduino-Controlled Servos**: The physical hand, controlled by servo motors, displays the computerâ€™s chosen gesture.
  
## Components Used

- **Arduino Uno**: To control the servos that move the cardboard hand.
- **Python**: The main programming language used for gesture recognition, serial communication, and controlling the game. Key libraries include:
  - `mediapipe`: For hand tracking and gesture detection.
  - `serial`: To communicate with the Arduino.
  - `OpenCV`: For camera input and video processing.
- **Servo Motors**: Used to control the movements of the cardboard hand.
- **3-Fingered Hand Replicating the Original Hand (Cardboard Cutouts)**: A cardboard hand connected with rubber bands to hold the gestures in place.

## How it Works

1. **Hand Gesture Detection**: 
   - The program tracks hand gestures using MediaPipe's hand-tracking functionality.
   - For each gesture (Rock, Paper, Scissors), specific conditions are checked based on the coordinates of the finger tips and joints:
     - For **Paper**, the tip of all fingers and the middle joint should be above the MCP (metacarpophalangeal) joint.
     - Similar logic is used for **Rock** and **Scissors**.
   
2. **Serial Communication with Arduino**: 
   - After detecting the gesture, the program communicates with the Arduino using serial communication.
   - The Arduino controls the servo motors, which move a cardboard hand to show the computer's counter gesture.

3. **Cardboard Hand Setup**:
   - A 3-fingered hand is cut out of cardboard to replicate human hand gestures for Rock, Paper, and Scissors.
   - Rubber bands are attached to keep the fingers in position, while servos move them to mimic different gestures.
   - A resisting cardboard is placed behind the hand to ensure proper movement.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Hardware Setup**:
   - Cut out a cardboard hand with 3 fingers that can show Rock, Paper, and Scissors gestures.
   - Connect the cardboard fingers using rubber bands to keep them stretched out.
   - Mount the hand onto a base with servos attached to control each finger.
   - Connect the servos to an Arduino Uno.

2. **Software Setup**:
   - Install Python and the following libraries:
     ```bash
     pip install mediapipe opencv-python pyserial
     ```
   - Clone or download this repository to get the Python code.

3. **Running the Program**:
   - Ensure your Arduino is connected to your computer.
   - Run the Python script to start the hand-tracking and game logic:
     ```bash
     python rock_paper_scissors.py
     ```

4. **Game Play**:
   - Show a Rock, Paper, or Scissors gesture to the camera.
   - The computer will recognize your gesture and move the cardboard hand to display the winning counter gesture.

## Customization

You can modify the game logic to add more cases or gestures by adjusting the hand-tracking conditions in the Python code. More details on how the detection works are provided in the code comments.

## Components List

- Arduino Uno
- Servo Motors (3 or more depending on your hand setup)
- Camera (for gesture detection)
- Python with the following libraries: `serial`, `mediapipe`, `opencv-python`
- Cardboard Hand Replicas (with 3 fingers)
